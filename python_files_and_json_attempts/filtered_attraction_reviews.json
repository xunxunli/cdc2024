    "text": "Nieuw Dakota is a new gallery in the very up and coming Amsterdam Noord. It is a large warehouse space for contemporary art. I visited last week, and they are currently showing an exhibition called &#39;New Saint Petersburg&#39;, showing work by several young artists from the Russian city. The exhibition has interesting paintings, tender photographic portraits, video installations and interactive pieces. Many of them are innately political pieces, challenging the perception of modern Russia in the throws of political change, and all are for sale. The space itself is very open and bright, situated right next to the N.S.D.M ferry port, a free ride from Central Station. The area is great to visit, and I had a wonderful time exploring all of the surrounding warehouse buildings and unique bars. This gallery is definitely worth a visit for its array of exhibitions and its fantastic location, and entry is free!",

De kwaliteit van de lessen is goed: ik bodyshape bij Conchita, step en yoga bij Sita en Bianca en pump bij Eudia en de lessen zijn stuk voor stuk goed.

Everyone made an effort to ensure that we had a good time and tbh it couldn&#39;t have been much better. The electronic scoreboard was clearly visible from all around the ground and the occasional commentary was pleasing to the ear.",

With just moments to spare before Diwali weekend, the team helped to frame up an immersive collection of 24 pratimajis from the Jain religion - meticulously carved figures that represent divinity - which my wife and I were able to present to my mother-in-law as a Diwali gift. Just looking at each of these one by one and contemplating on their elevated qualities can be enough to bring about focus and calm in our own everyday lives. The Art Gallery did a fantastic job with the frame, suggested we use a special type of non-reflective glass (which we went for) and kept the original packaging intact so that we could swap it back in the future if we chose to. I highly recommend The Art Gallery in Ruislip Manor - they are a terrific team who are caring, attentive and I get the feeling that they love the work they do. Suraj Shah, Ruislip Manor resident",

Fantastic collection of used cars that all tell a story, a must visit for any petrol head, run by enthusiastic friendly staff. Great collection containing mostly euro exotica and american muscle, all interesting and varying from used and tatty to pristine and immaculate, which adds to it&#39;s appeal, I&#39;d rather wander round a collection like this, than spend time in a museum with lots of pristine but unloved show pieces. All the staff are mega friendly and very helpful, and as mentioned by a previous contributor - the coffee is freshly ground and hot. Ideal venue for a car club meet, which the staff and boss are keen to encourage. If you&#39;re expecting something clinical like some of the other UK motor museums, you&#39;ll be disappointed, this is a great collection of interesting vehicles collected by a passionate enthusiast.",

Along Chamberlayne Road, past the gothic splendour of the Catholic Church of the Transfiguration, is Kensal Rise&#39;s Constitutional Club. Its old hall has taken on a remarkable new life. Inside is a gorgeous little cinema. With seats for 40 or so, it&#39;s hugely intimate and cosy, but with a sound system installed by the same chap who does U2&#39;s tours and crisp digital projection, it&#39;s serious about the experience. Dangling from the ceiling is a mesmerising lighting installation by Bruce Munro, fading gently from one hue to another. It&#39;s a proper community here \u2013 half the audience either know each other or know the Lexi staff, and there&#39;s a true feel of locals. Everyone chats before the film. The seats are comfy, with candlelit tables at the front, and each film is personally introduced, harking back to an era where you didn&#39;t just go and see a movie, you went out to the cinema. There are often Q&amp;As with directors or added bits of theatre here and there; they even do a night where the New York Met Opera is beamed live to the assembled, black-tied, admirers. What really sets the Lexi apart is its mission. All the profits, from tickets to drinks to popcorn, go to a South African charity called The Sustainability Institute \u2013 which means they&#39;re probably the only cinema in London which actively encourages you to drink wine whilst watching a film. We&#39;ll take that. We won&#39;t say more, just go.",

The location is super for me, the size of the gym is just right with class sizes maximising the feeling of group training if you want it but without ever feeling too overcrowded, and the atmosphere is always friendly and supportive. You can plan your work out to suit your preference. I go to the evening power classes 2-3 times a week in the winters and the early morning classes in the spring and summer. 30 mins cardio plus 15 mins core and 15 mins stretch gives a really enjoyable manageable all over workout and you feel absolutely great afterwards. I also did a session of 10 power plate classes which were excellent and saw almost immediate results in strength in and toning. The trainers are like your buddies in the gym. Always full of chat and smiles. The fact that it&#39;s a womens only gym gives a sense of complete comfort and ease when training. Furthermore the training programmes are carefully designed to suit the female structure and body. we are not the same as the boys!! Overall, i would genuinely highly recommend this gym for women of any age, fitness level, beginner to advanced gymer :)",

You cannot cover even a fraction of what this Museum offers in one day, but since it is free (like all major museums in London) you can target what you want to see each time you visit. If culture and history are something you enjoy then I would highly recommend this for days out in London. I always put money in the collection stations on the way out.... and would hope that if anyone enjoys their visit that they would do the same.",

You&#39;ll see light through glass illuminating sculptures, peer at objects through open spaces and see crafted mouldings that come alive at different angles. Soane really did create an immersive physical experience out of the space. His efforts to create and furnish his house with clutter and objects from around the world means you&#39;ll always see something new. I&#39;m a kleptomaniac too, so it&#39;s nice to see someone keeping a range of such eclectic objects that all have relevance and meaning. It&#39;s great to spend an hour here then come back every year. Every time you&#39;ll see more objects and bits of curiosity. It&#39;s free too and near a great pub called The Ship Tavern on Gate St that&#39;s well worth a visit- decent real ale and pies. Top tip: the first Tuesday of every month is open by candlelight. Great for a date night in the or autumn or winter.",

There is a regular food market on weekends, selling all different types of delicious street food. The view from the top floor out over the Thames is spectacular, although a lot of people don&#39;t seem to know about it. It&#39;s a great place to take tourists.",

It&#39;s a very comfortable ride, and if you don&#39;t mind a bit of cold, the views on the upper deck are spectacular. We had Simon, who was part of the crew, who guided us with some excellent commentary along the way. Travelling along the Thames, there were a lot of things I didn&#39;t know about, and a LOT of Pubs that I didn&#39;t realize had quite the history. Apparently, the crew know their pubs along the Thames quite well! Again, a great way to travel one of the most important parts of London, the River Thames, I highly recommend getting in on one of the cruises.",

I&#39;ve just returned from yet another mind-nourishing wander around it&#39;s huge halls. There are two things I&#39;ve always enjoyed most about the Tate. Firstly, the thematic presentation of it&#39;s work. Rather than chronological periods, the art is grouped into collections, such as &#39;states of flux&#39; and &#39;poetry and dreams&#39;, which place old classics in new context and allow visitors to listen in on the interesting conversations going on between the art and artists across large periods of time. Secondly, it is constantly changing. No two trips to the gallery are ever the same. Walls have moved. Grand new projects have been set up in Turbine Hall. Art has disappeared and new work has emerged. Read more about my experience and see my photos on Triptease.",

I am a student and I have even used the cafe area of the gym to work on my computer several times (using the free wifi), as I normally go there after the library. Concerning the gym&#39;s extra facilities, bicycle parking always comes in handy.

Great location, very close to Liverpool Street Station but in a tranquil side street. Was met by James and his two dachshunds - definitely got the right karma - no barking, just big melty brown eyes. Then followed the most thorough deep tissue massage I have ever had - not for the faint-hearted but you definitely get your money&#39;s worth! I felt like a different woman afterwards and, a week on, can still feel the benefits. I thoroughtly recommend this and will definitely go back next time I am in London",

I walked past PTbyPT on a regular basis but never thought of joining, until one day I just had enough and wanted to start feeling fitter and getting back into shape. So I started in January 2013 and to date I have experienced a complete change in life style, I have lost a huge amount of weight, changed my look, even had to purchase a new wardrobe. They offer a very personal experience and make you feel as though you are there only client. I have now moved further away from the gym but I still go, it&#39;s like a drug. As I keep telling Phillip, PT is addictive. This is the one place where results will show. BEST PLACE EVER!!!!!!",

They also do some great monthly deals too and I can never resist those as they are such great value. It&#39;s such a gorgeous place and all of the staff are very professional and friendly without being over familiar which I love. Thank you Amara for looking after me for so long - you&#39;re awesome!

I have vivid memories of spending what seemed like hours staring through the glass at all sorts of stuffed animals that I&#39;d never seen before - the animals were a lot bigger when I was six years old! Then as I got older I&#39;d be taken there on school trips to study more about our current class projects such as Anicent Egypt and biodiversity. Not many children are fortunate enough to have such an important cultural resource like the Horniman Museum anywhere near them. I last visited the Museum during the summer last year during the build-up to the London Olympics to see &#39;The Body Adorned: Dressing London&#39;, an exhibition which explored the question of what we wear and why. It proved to me how London embraces diversity and that different cultures, however distinct, complement each other in this city and make us richer people. I would recommend going to visit for a long day during the weekend in July/August when you can enjoy a variety of events which take place in the Gardens, like classical concerts and latin dance performances - a great way to end a trip to the museum!",

I have had a great experience at this gym - staff are friendly and dedicated. Most members (even the few muscle heads!) are pleasant welcoming and friendly. There is a very unique community/family feel among staff and members, The studio has regular classes (the usual: spin, pilates, yoga, zumba) and are free to members. When the studio is not in use, it is additional space for members to use. There are also regular social events occasionally at the gym and occasionally in the local area. Personal training is available. For what it is (a neighborhood gym) and for the price and membership deals, this is an excellent place.

It&#39;s great hearing and learning about the history but unless you have a guide telling you how the channels in the arena were made and what the reconstruction looked like you might not get that much out of it. It is good seeing the ruins of such an old building which has survived this long, however it can be seen in an hour. I have to admit since I was on the Rome Segway Tour before we were shown videos of how it was built and looked like, so probably taking away the surprise of the Colosseum. There is a fee to get in, but the easiest way to get in is to either (1) buy a ticket for the Roman Forum which is a combined ticket to get into AR BONITO E GRANDE",

Live the experience of a massage tantric allows us to explore ourselves from the interior and to discover the god that we all have in us. It is the most beautiful gift that we can offer to ourselves. My massage has been prodigaled by a goddess tantrika (Ava). To a very great sensuality, she knows how awaken the Kundalini (pure sexual energy) which lurks in each of us. With a breathing synchronized, the massage is done in soul to soul and we realize how we are all connect to make one. We have the impression that a portal opens and the time stops. I wished that this moment is eternal. This experience must be live in the present moment in fully abandon themselves without having expectations. Ava will give you what you wish to at the time that you must receive it. It is sufficient to release the magic by itself. This magic will give you emotions and sensations that go well beyond that a simple sensual massage. There is no word for the described. The only way to discover it is to live. Thank you Ava for this wonderful time shared together.",

The staff were incredible, and are what set our stay here above everywhere else we stayed on our trip. Multi-lingual, courteous and exceptionally helpful, even going out of their way to help us with a Sunday morning medical issue. Thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone.",

J&#39;ai trouv\u00e9 que l&#39;endroit \u00e9tait bien choisi pour l&#39;\u00e9v\u00e9nement. La nef du Grand Palais est si grande qu&#39;on \u00e9tait plus 500 \u00e0 \u00eatre ! Pensez \u00e0 regarder la verri\u00e8re du Grand Palais c&#39;est ce qui rend l&#39;espace plus original mise \u00e0 part son histoire !",

    "text": "I was in this beautiful area of Paris with my parents, and I litteraly lose my self in those street crowded of art galleries. But especially I fell in love for Galerie Artelie. Inside you can see not the usual series of paintings now so common among modern and contemporary art. In this gallery you can find instead pure energy, freshness, strength, novelty. The real &quot;Street art&quot;, refined, always with a focus not only in an excellent aesthetic sense but also in the communication of a message. The owner, Eliane Kowsman, is very kind and aviable for the client. I was really happy to find a gallery that really lends attention to client and on the works and to participate in several events to be constantly updated. I suggest strongly to take a step if you are in Paris, you will not be disappointe and to subscrive at the newsletter on the web site of the gallery to be constantly informed.",

Famous for Focault&#39;s pendulum (and the site of Umberto Eco&#39;s novel), but it also has Focault&#39;s gyroscope, with its microscope to see the slow change as the earth rotates around it. Also Lavoisier&#39;s apparatus for weighing hydrogen and oxygen before combining them to make water, looms controlled by punched paper tape, shutter-based &quot;telegraphs&quot; like those in the Count of Monte Cristo, and lots more. I suppose one could walk through in an hour or so, but allow several hours if you like looking at amazing devices and trying to figure out how they work. Some, like the machine for making metal files, are illustrated by videos, some of which don&#39;t work. Overall, not as much written explanation as I would have liked -- did the bat-inspired airplane really fly? -- and no docents, but maybe the audio tour would have answered some of my questions.",

    "text": "&quot;Simon&quot; is a tiny umbrella shop that&#39;s been in continuous operation since 1897, and the current owner, the granddaughter of the man who opened it, has been making and selling umbrellas and parasols since 1958. She speaks no or very little English, but her assistant speaks &lt;i&gt;excellent&lt;/i&gt; English and they are both VERY charming and helpful. Shopping there is an experience of the past, when it was about display and love for the product. The price is on a discreet little tag, and there is never, ever any rush for the register. If you wish you could take all day in there, and the two ladies of the shop would graciously show off their favorite pieces and what they think you might like. There is a huge variety, from fairly inexpensive to pieces that are... well, not. There are umbrellas and canes that are discreet, elegant, flashy, or whimsical. There are umbrellas with newspaper print or watercolor art, lineart prints of Paris, umbrellas with ruffled rims that look like bouquets when folded, delicate lace and linen sun parasols in all colors... if you like modern and elegant, it&#39;s there. If you like Victorian and Lolita you might think you&#39;ve just gone to parasol heaven, and most of them the owner handmakes, herself, above the shop. Including the frames, which are VERY well-made and she assured me handled quite well in the wind- she even had a prototype designed for VERY high winds, sun, and rain- deep purple, covered in black lace. If you go to Paris for a visit, and parasols, canes, or costuming is dear to your heart, then you MUST visit this little shop. It&#39;s a jewel of the city.",

Los vestuarios son incre\u00edbles, me qued\u00e9 muy sorprendida con el comentario de M, dado que realmente me parece todo lo contrario de lo que comenta... en mi opini\u00f3n y experiencia, las instalaciones realmente merecen un 10, el personal es correcto y la relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio es perfecta!!!",

The works are not all about Cubism but include a number of unique juvenile works describing the history and the growth of the individual and the artist. Another exhibition core, Las Meninas, and its several studies, are an incredible dialogue of two geniuses and are a corner stone key of reading of Cubsim analysis. Temporary exhibitions too are top quality and always worth a visit. It&#39;s generally quite busy, so pick time carefully.",

Barcelona is of course a wonderful city,so I try to get back there whenever I can,and I always head for Artevistas to check out what new and exciting artists they&#39;ve found. I&#39;ve bought work there by a few artists,including Miguel Leal and Sarmiento,and I LOVE all the pieces I&#39;ve bought! The gallery always sells work at remarkably fair prices - at least some of the art I&#39;ve bought there is now worth considerably more than I paid for it,but the main thing is that I have work by some very exciting emerging artists. Eric and Frederic are always very helpful and friendly,and they&#39;ll send work around the world if it&#39;s too big to go in your suitcase! (Again at very reasonable rates). All in all I would highly recommend a visit to Artevistas in fabulous Barcelona - and I can&#39;t wait to return there myself!",

This little bus will drop you off close to where the touristic action is, but be careful because it only runs until 8 PM, and in summer it is very easy to get lost in the beautiful Firenze nights.

    "text": "I really enjoyed my stay here in this luxury resort. I had a large room with a cool terrace where I could enjoy some Tuscan wine at sunset, plus had a design bathtub that was quite unexpected in the room. It was my first time in Tuscany and I must say that starting and ending my vacation in this hidden, green place, isolated from mass tourism and yet so close to Sienna, Pisa and Florence, even Rome, was the best option. At the end of April the weather was lovely and I was able to stroll by the beaches, although I didn&#39;t bathe. The waters looked very clean and inviting though! Loved the food at the restaurant and enjoyed a couple of spa treatments. I do not golf, but the course looked inviting and I did think about getting a golf lesson. Maybe on my next trip back in Tuscany!",

La pulizia si sente! (non mi sono sbagliato), quando si sente significa che c&#39;\u00e8 buon profumo di pulito. Le stanze spaziose ed accoglienti, sempre tenute perfette dalle Tate, che con la loro presenza discreta offrono all&#39;ospite la sensazione di essere a casa propria. La colazione il momento pi\u00f9 delicato da offrire all&#39;ospite, la dolcezza, la musica, la ricerca di offrire al cliente il sapore di casa, rende questo momento un inizio di giornata all&#39;insegna del buonumore. La presenza discreta ma sempre presente della Direttrice, danno la sensazione di essere avvolti in un panno ovattato, in cui farsi cullare da tutte le persone che lavorano in questo Hotel. Le quattro stelle meritate abbondantemente anche dalla presenza di un centro benessere, molto ben incastonato in questa albergo. Il mio consiglio: Sei un cliente business, assapora la tranquillit\u00e0 della cena, dopo una giornata di lavoro essere coccolati con il cibo \u00e8 la miglior cosa. Per le coppie: utilizzate i servizi offerti Centro Benessere, e il Dolce VIta, splendida struttura per accoglierti nella magnifica spiaggia di Marina di Grosseto.",
